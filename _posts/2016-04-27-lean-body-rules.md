LEAN BODY RULES

1\. Eat Clean - If God made it, then eat it. Pay close attention to the food labels. Is it made of mostly natural ingredients? Does it contain added sugars? Is it processed? Chemically enhanced? Artificial?

2\. Meal Prep

Start investing one or two days to meal prep all your food for the week. It will save you a ton of time, energy, and calories! In addition, you will be able to have well-balanced meals throughout the day knowing exactly how much carbs, protein, and fat you are consuming.

3\. Avoid These

Avoid simple carbs like white breads, cookies, soda, and most baked goods. If not used immediately, these carbs will be stored as fat! Avoid fried foods!! There is no nutritional benefit out of it. Lastly, avoid processed meats especially when containing sodium nitrate. E.g., lunch meats, hot dogs, jerky, etc.

4\. Eat every 3-3.5hrs. - Meal frequency affects your overall metabolism by slightly increasing every time you eat. So, if you have six meals a day, then your body will experience six metabolic surges. If you do not eat after three hours, your body starts to store body fat (starvation mode). Although you are having more meals, portion sizes are all still controlled depending on your daily caloric intake for fat burning.

5\. Watch Your Sodium - Nowadays, food is loaded with hidden salt to increase shelf life. You could be eating clean and watching your calories, but consuming too much salt might be the reason why you're not leaning out. Sodium in most cases is known to cause water retention (which makes you look bloaty). Try choosing condiments that contain less than 60mg per serving or limit your daily intake to no more than 1200mg a day.

6\. Weigh Your Food - Whether you're looking to lose weight, maintain, or put on some mass, regulating the size of food portions could help you reach your fitness goals.

7\. Substitute your "Must-Haves" - Instead of sugar, replace with stevia. Must have your creamer with coffee in the morning? No problem, swap with Walden Farms coffee creamers. Need your bbq sauce with your chicken? Switch to zero sugar bbq sauce. Drink soda on a regular? Simply replace with seltzer water and BCAAs or water flavoring (e.g., Crystal Geyser). Need a sweet tooth fix? Warm up some protein bars in the oven or mix nonfat greek yogurt with your favorite protein powder.

8\. Eat Your Macros - Make sure you're always getting a balanced meal with one serving of each macro (carbohydrate, protein, & fat). For instance, you wouldn't want to eat a carbohydrate by itself. Rather, pair it up with a protein.

9\. Consume Only Healthy Fats - Such as avocados, nuts, and omegas, healthy fats are necessary nutrients the body needs for optimal health and well-being. Without the sufficient intake of these fats, the body would fail to function properly.

10\. Protein Before Training - Consuming some type of protein or amino acids beforehand will help fuel your muscles during training. By doing so, it will start protein synthesis in the body during your workout session and prevent any muscle breakdown.

11\. Cheat Meal NOT Cheat Day - You could be setting yourself back a few weeks if you binge on a full-on cheat day! You're better off just having a healthy cheat MEAL to satisfy those cravings and prevent deprivation.

12\. Sleep - Getting adequate sleep (about 8 hours) ensures physical and mental recovery. Studies have shown that not getting enough sleep can be a perfect recipe for weight gain.

13\. Limit Fruit Intake -

Yes, fruits provide you with many vitamins and minerals. However, the fructose still counts as sugar (sugar is sugar)! Stick to a cup per serving of berries or watermelon for lower intake.

14\. Hydrate - As research shows, restriction of water promotes fat retention due to the defense mechanism of stress. Water plays a vital role in cleansing out waste while transporting nutrients in the body. And without proper hydration, the body will instead preserve fat and water. Drink at least a gallon a day to prevent that from happening.

15\. Read Nutrition Label -

Start memorizing this with certain foods you eat from day to day. Especially, if you' re eating from something packaged...Make sure you know exactly how many servings and the macros you' re taking in. Being blinded could jeopardize your gains.
